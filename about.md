Hello. My name is Sung-Yub Kim.
I am a graduate student in MS/Optimization Lab in SNU(http://polytope.snu.ac.kr).
My interests are Optimization, RL, Deep Learning(especially GAN&NTM).
I post here about those subjects.

If you have any issue on my posts or relevant subjects, pleas mail me(edmophia@snu.ac.kr).
